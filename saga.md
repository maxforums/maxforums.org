# The Epic Saga of Maxforums

In the beginning there was spoon and only spoon. In 1997 he said, “let there be Maxforums,” and it was done. He gazed upon his work, and it was good (or more accurately, it was "spooned").

Once established, reprobates from all over the planet found each other in this peculiar corner of the Internet. Fiercely independent, neurodivergent, smart, talented, and unique individuals who possessed a rare blend of technical and artistic sensibilities. Many were of the age that grew up alongside the internet itself. Some younger. Some older. Some waaaaay older. :kekw:

## The early years

1997-2000 (todo: expand this section, check dates)

## The golden age of Maxforums

2001-2011 (todo: expand this section, check dates)

## Rise of Social Media, and the Spam/Trolling epidemic

2012-2020 (todo: expand this section, check dates).

The rise of Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms meant that trends were shifting away from forums. Also Google and YouTube made it easier than ever to find 3D Studio Max learning resources... without having to actually talk to people. :P

## Sunset

Spoon announced shortly after the redesign was launched in 2018 that he intended to sunset maxforums and retire from the project eventually. Forum engagement had trailed off and Mods had gotten burned out on dealing with spam and trolling. As the sole developer on a custom codebase, it had become increasingly difficult to meet community demands for feature partiy with other forum software. Also the global interest in 3D Studio Max seemed to have fallen relative to other software such as Maya, C4D, and Blender.

In 2022 after ample warning to the community and time to move active conversations from the forum to discord, spoon finally pulled the plug on Maxforums. So long and thanks for all the fish!

It had a good run, but after 25 years, it was time to say goodbye to the old forum. <3

## Discord Era

In 2020 Sir Manfred started the Maxforums discord which breathed new life into the community. The old timers had a new place to meet up that felt a lot like the old IRC chat.

## Foundation

In 2024 maxforums.org domain expired and was acquired by a third party not associated with the MF community. Unfortunately that owner was part of “the wrong crowd” and were a poor influence on maxforums.org’s otherwise pure, innocent, and untainted nature and reputation. Maxforums.org went through a sort of latent rebellious adolescence by deciding to spend a year as an Indonesian Phishing scam which ultimately got it blacklisted by several prominent public security databases.

But fate it would seem *does* believe in second chances…

The phishing scame people abandoned the domain after it started getting blacklisted. One would have to individually contact each security vendor to request a reevaluation.

And that is exactly what we ended up doing. :kekw:

In 2025 Odie was able to acquire the domain in an online auction. After reinstating the final memorial page, and and getting the domain back to an "STD-free" state, he proposed, in collaboration with Sir Manfred and Soontekk, to set up a Maxforums Foundation of sorts, inspired by the Blender Foundation. A community owned and operated nonprofit that will live on beyond Spoon's retirement, and own the domain going forward...
