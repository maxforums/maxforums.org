## Overview

This repository drives [maxforums.org](https://maxforums.org) and is a 1:1 representation of the static website that GitHub automatically builds, deploys, and hosts through their free [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) system, well suited for static, non-interactive splash pages like what is being served now.

As of 8 September, 2025, maxforums.org has been pointing to a copy of the [last valid `html`](https://web.archive.org/web/20231205223116/https://www.maxforums.org/) to appear under the Maxforums banner before temporarily going dark.

## Architecture

[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a [Static Site Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator), to build and deploy changes to the website. Real-time dynamic applications on GitHub Pages are only possible with services, such as with a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org) architecture.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_stack#JAMstack):

> JAMstack (also stylized as Jamstack) is a web development architecture pattern and solution stack. The acronym "JAM" stands for JavaScript, API and Markup (generated by a static site generator) and was coined by Mathias (Matt) Biilmann, CEO of Netlify, in 2015. The idea of combining the use of JavaScript, APIs and markup has existed since the beginnings of HTML5.
> 
> In JAMstack websites, the application logic typically resides on the client side (for example, an embedded e-commerce checkout service that interacts with pre-rendered static content), without being tightly coupled to a backend server. JAMstack sites are usually served with a Git-based or headless CMS.

### Domain

DNS records are being managed for free through [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/free/). The domain is temporarily registerd with NameBright. There is an [open issue](https://github.com/maxforums/maxforums.org/issues/6) to select a suitable long-term domain registrar.
