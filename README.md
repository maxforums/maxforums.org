## Overview

This repository drives [maxforums.org](https://maxforums.org) and is a 1:1 representation of the static website that GitHub automatically builds, deploys, and hosts through their free [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) system, well suited for static, non-interactive splash pages like what is being served now.

As of 8 September, 2025, maxforums.org is pointing to a continuation of the [last valid `html`](https://web.archive.org/web/20231205223116/https://www.maxforums.org/) to appear under the Maxforums banner before temporarily going dark.

## Architecture

[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a [Static Site Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator), to build and deploy changes to the website. Real-time dynamic applications on GitHub Pages are only possible with services, such as with a [Jamstack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_stack#JAMstack) architecture.

## Domain

`maxforums.org` DNS records are being managed for free through [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/free/). The domain is temporarily registerd with NameBright. There is an [open issue](https://github.com/maxforums/maxforums.org/issues/6) to select a suitable long-term domain registrar.
