## Overview

This repository drives [maxforums.org](https://maxforums.org) and is a 1:1 representation of the static website that GitHub automatically builds, deploys, and hosts through their free [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) system, well suited for static, non-interactive splash pages like what is being served now.

As of 8 September, 2025, maxforums.org has been pointing to a copy of the [last valid `html`](https://web.archive.org/web/20231205223116/https://www.maxforums.org/) to appear under the Maxforums banner before temporarily going dark.

## Architecture

[GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)s uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a [Static Site Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator), to build and deploy changes to the website. Real-time dynamic applications on GitHub Pages are only possible with services, such as with a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org) architecture.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_stack#JAMstack):

> JAMstack (also stylized as Jamstack) is a web development architecture pattern and solution stack. The acronym "JAM" stands for JavaScript, API and Markup (generated by a static site generator) and was coined by Mathias (Matt) Biilmann, CEO of Netlify, in 2015.[20] The idea of combining the use of JavaScript, APIs and markup has existed since the beginnings of HTML5.
> 
> In JAMstack websites, the application logic typically resides on the client side (for example, an embedded e-commerce checkout service that interacts with pre-rendered static content), without being tightly coupled to a backend server. JAMstack sites are usually served with a Git-based or headless CMS.
